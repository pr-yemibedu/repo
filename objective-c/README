== Description ==
This was developed on an ubuntu system.  The following installations were run:

apt-get install gnustep gnustep-devel gnustep-devel-core -y

== Building ==

The compilation of GNUstep programs can be complex, so it's recommended you
Create the file "GNUmakefile" to be used as input for make.

# Make sure the environment is setup correctly by running ". /usr/share/GNUstep/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh"
# Run "make" to build
# This will create a HelloWorld.app directory that contains the entire application and it's portable (move the diretory anywhere).
# Make sure the directory that HelloWorld.app sits in it part of the PATH environment variable.
#* export PATH=.:$PATH
# Run "openapp <appname here>"
# Run "make clean" to clean up

== Notes ==
openapp is the program that runs GNUStep applications
