And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one, through Christ Jesus our Lord. For Thine is the Kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.

<p>
    	Let us give thanks unto the Beneficent and Merciful God, the Father of our Lord, God and Saviour, Jesus Christ. For He has shielded us, rescued us, kept us, accepted us unto Him, had compassion on us, supported us, and brought us unto this hour. Let us ask Him also, to keep us this holy day and all the days of our life in all peace, the Almighty Lord our God. O Master, Lord, God Almighty, Father of our Lord, God and Saviour Jesus Christ; we thank Thee upon every condition, for any condition, and in whatever condition. For Thou hast shielded us, rescued us, kept us, accepted us unto Thee, had compassion on us, supported us and brought us unto this hour. Therefore we ask and entreat Thy goodness, O Lover-of-man, grant us to complete this holy day, and all the days of our life in all peace with Thy fear. All envy, all temptation, all the influence of Satan, the intrigue of wicked people, the rising up of enemies, hidden and manifest, take away from us, and from all Thy people, and from this, Thy holy place. Butas for those things which are good and useful provide us with them. For Thou art the One who gave us the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions and every power of the enemy. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one, through the grace, compassion and love of man, of Thine only begotten Son, our Lord, God and Saviour, Jesus Christ. Through whom glory, honor, dominion, and worship befit Thee with Him and the Holy Spirit, the lifegiver who is of one essence with Thee, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.

<p>
    	Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of Thy compassion blot out my transgression. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I know mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before me. Against Thee only have I sinned and done this evil before Thee, that Thou mightiest be justified in Thy words, and prevail when Thou art judged. For behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother bear me. For behold, Thou hast loved truth; the hidden and secret things of Thy wisdom hast Thou made manifest unto me. Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be made clean; Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. Thou shalt make me to hear joy and gladness; the bones that be humbled, they shall rejoice. Turn Thy face away from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and with Thy governing Spirit establish me. I shall teach transgressors Thy ways, and the ungodly shall turn back unto Thee. Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; my tongue shall rejoice in Thy righteousness. O Lord, Thou shalt open my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy praise. For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I had given it; with whole-burnt offerings Thou shalt not be pleased. A sacrifice unto God is a broken spirit; a heart that is broken and humbled God will not despise. Do good, O Lord, in Thy good pleasure unto Sion, and let the walls of Jerusalem be built. Then shalt Thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, with oblation and whole-burnt offerings. Then shall they offer bullocks upon Thine altar. Alleluia.
